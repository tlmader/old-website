        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Ted. I study computer science at the University of New Orleans and work for GE Digital Solutions. I am a currently a junior, and I expect to graduate in 2017. My goal is to acquire the skills necessary in designing practical and robust software. My pastimes include video gaming, working out, playing the guitar, listening to electronic music, and exploring style and fashion. I'm always willing to try new things and experience what the world is willing to offer.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p> I am a software engineering intern at the GE Digital Solutions Technology Center in New Orleans. I work on developing service-oriented applications using technologies such as Predix, Spring Framework, and AngularJS. I am experienced with Java, C#, ASP.NET, web development, PostgreSQL and Oracle DB databases, and Agile software development.</p>

                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>As an avid gamer, I also enjoy developing video games. I have used tools such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Phaser to create small game projects. You can view my projects <a href="#/projects">here</a>. I have played a development role in Honest Abe, a game designed and built by students in the computer science department at UNO. I usually play games on PC, and my current favorite video games are Guild Wars, Undertale, Dark Souls, and Minecraft.</p>

                <h3>Style and Fashion</h3>
                <p>Throughout the years, I started off with Southern prep attire, and I began to learn basic fit rules and moved towards heritage/workwear. I dabbled a bit with streetwear, and have eventually settled down with Visvim/future vintage/indigo-focused apparel. My favorite designers are Hiroki Nakamura (Visvim), Daiki Suzuki (Engineered Garments/Nepenthes), and Rei Kawakubo (Comme des Gar√ßons).</p>
