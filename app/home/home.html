                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p> I am a software engineering intern at the GE Digital Solutions Technology Center in New Orleans. I work with Agile development teams on developing web applications using technologies such as Spring Framework, ASP .NET, and AngularJS. I am experienced with Java, C#, service-oriented architecture, web development, and databases. On the side, I have dabbled with Python, Android SDK, and x86 Assembly.</p>

                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>As an avid gamer, I also enjoy programming and designing for video games. I have used tools such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Phaser to create small game projects. You can view my projects <a href="#/projects">here</a>. I am currently the lead developer of Honest Abe, a game in development by students in the computer science department at UNO. My current favorite games are Guild Wars, Minecraft, Terraria, and Civilization V.</p>

                <h3>Style and Fashion</h3>
                <p>Men's fashion became a recent hobby for me. From studying and seeking inspiration from online communities, blogs, and designers, I began to apply the same precision used in designing software to my personal style. I draw most of my influences from Japanese workwear and vintage Americana. My favorite brands include Apolis, Filson, Gitman Vintage, and Velva Sheen. Hiroki Nakamura and Daiki Suzuki inspire me.</p>
